#  Telecom Customer churn prediction project(Interactive Dashboard creation using Microsoft PowerBI)
## Objective:
To analyze and visualize customer behavior and churn patterns using Power BI, enabling stakeholders to identify key factors influencing churn and make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.
## Myproject-Dashboard
I developed a project to visualize customer churn insights using interactive dashboards created in Power BI. It includes key metrics such as churn rate, average charges, and tenure, with demographic and contract-based filtering.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/kiruba-07/Myproject-Dashboard/blob/main/Telco_customer_churn_prediction.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Process
### Data Collection & Cleaning
Imported the Telco Customer Churn dataset, handled missing values, and converted data types for analysis.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored churn patterns across gender, contract types, tenure, and monthly charges using visual summaries.
### Feature Engineering
Calculated new metrics like churn rate (%) and average tenure using DAX in Power BI.
### Dashboard Creation in Power BI
Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and slicers for user-driven insights.
### Business Insights
Identified that customers with shorter tenure and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

## Project Insights
- Churn Rate is around 27%, indicating a significant portion of customers are leaving the service.
- Customers with month-to-month contracts show a much higher churn rate than those with long-term contracts.
- Shorter tenure customers are more likely to churn, showing lower brand loyalty in the early months.
- Average monthly charges are higher among churned customers, suggesting pricing may influence churn.
- Female and male customers churn at similar rates, meaning gender does not heavily impact churn.
