#  Telecom Customer churn prediction project(Interactive Dashboard creation using Microsoft PowerBI)
## Objective:
To analyze and visualize customer behavior and churn patterns using Power BI, enabling stakeholders to identify key factors influencing churn and make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.
## Myproject-Dashboard
I developed a project to visualize customer churn insights using interactive dashboards created in Power BI. It includes key metrics such as churn rate, average charges, and tenure, with demographic and contract-based filtering.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/kiruba-07/Myproject-Dashboard/blob/main/Telco_customer_churn_prediction.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Process
### Data Collection & Cleaning
Imported the Telco Customer Churn dataset, handled missing values, and converted data types for analysis.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored churn patterns across gender, contract types, tenure, and monthly charges using visual summaries.
### Feature Engineering
Calculated new metrics like churn rate (%) and average tenure using DAX in Power BI.
### Dashboard Creation in Power BI
Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and slicers for user-driven insights.
### Business Insights
Identified that customers with shorter tenure and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

## Project Insights
- **Churn Rate:** Around **27%** of customers have churned, showing a high customer loss.
- **Contract Type:** Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn compared to those with yearly contracts.
- **Tenure:** Customers with **shorter tenure** are more prone to churn, indicating low initial loyalty.
- **Monthly Charges:** **Churned customers** tend to have **higher monthly charges**, suggesting pricing may be a factor.
- **Gender Impact:** **Both male and female** customers churn at nearly the same rate, showing no strong gender-based trend.
## Conclusion
This project successfully identified key factors influencing customer churn using data analysis and machine learning. Insights such as high churn among month-to-month contract users and those with higher monthly charges can help businesses improve customer retention strategies. The dashboard built with Power BI provides an interactive view of churn metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making for reducing customer loss.
